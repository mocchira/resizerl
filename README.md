`resizerl`
====================

Overview
--------

* "resizerl" is a image resizing module backed by OpenCV, ImageMagic, GraphicsMagic and so on.
* Currently supported only OpenCV. Have a plan to implement by ImageMagic, GraphicsMagic and so on.
* Currently implemented by C-Port. Have a plan to implement by NIF/LinkedinDriver.
* There are lots of TODOs like unit testings, error handlings, based on otp, benchmarkings...
* "resizerl" depends on [OpenCV](http://opencv.org/) so that OpenCV needs to be installed beforehand. Modules needed are core, imgproc and highgui.
